"""Pygame event, screen, and draw wrappers.

This module provides a thin abstraction layer over pygame operations for
better testability and separation of concerns. It wraps:
- Event polling
- Screen initialization and updates
- Basic drawing primitives (rect, circle, line)
- Surface creation

The adapter provides no game logic - it's purely an IO interface.
