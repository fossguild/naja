"""Simplified BoardRenderSystem - renders only board, grid and basic tiles.

This system follows ECS Single Responsibility Principle by handling ONLY:
- Board background
- Grid lines
- Basic tile rendering from Board state

UI elements (score, speed bar, etc.) are handled by separate UI systems.
Entity rendering is handled by EntityRenderSystem.
Snake rendering is handled by SnakeRenderSystem.
