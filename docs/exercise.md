Directions for the Programming Exercise
=======================================

The exercise consists of addressing some known issues and enhancing the game
by adding new features.

Before diving into the code, please observe the following notes:

* First, note that the exercise is not about contributing to KobraPy itself.
  KobraPy is the learning resource and codebase you should use as a starting
  point for this programming exercise. If you want to contribute to KobraPy,
  that’s great—but the exercise requires creating a new project based on
  KobraPy and extending it further.

  If you are experimenting with KobraPy in the context of a training program,
  your instructor may provide directions on how to create your new project and
  how to import the KobraPy codebase into it.

  Alternatively, if you are working independently, the recommended approach
  is not to fork KobraPy on GitHub. Forking would be correct if you wanted to
  contribute to KobraPy, but not for completing this exercise. Instead, create
  your own project and then copy KobraPy into it.

  You will then edit your own project’s code.

* Second, when you create your project, you should give it a name. Every fellow
  programmer knows the weight of responsibility in this sacred ritual. Perhaps
  your instructor has already chosen one for you. If not—choose wisely.

* Every time you incorporate KobraPy code into your new project, you are
  creating a derivative work. This happens when you either edit a source file
  copied from KobraPy or copy/paste code from KobraPy into a file you created.

  Since it is a derivative work, you must edit the copyright notice in that file
  to identify yourself as a co-author, while still crediting KobraPy. Do not	
  remove existing names—just add yours. Also include a visible comment stating
  that this is a derivative work from KobraPy.

* You should also edit the documentation in your repository:

  ```
  - README.md			
  - AUTHORS			
  - docs/manual.md
  - docs/CONTRIBUTING.md
  ```

  These documentation files should describe **your project**, not KobraPy.

* KobraPy, in its current state, purposely includes a few known bugs
  that you must fix. There is also a list of requested features to inspire
  you. (These are optional—you may design your own enhancements.)

  The list of bugs and feature requests is in `docs/issues.md`.

  For each fix or feature you plan to work on, create a corresponding entry in
your repository’s GitHub issue tracker.

* Unless your instructor advises otherwise, make your project compatible
  with the rules and conventions in `docs/conventions.md`.

  Use this file as a template for your project’s `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

  Create corresponding entries in your repository’s GitHub issue tracker.

* Set up a few milestones for your project in GitHub, and assign issues
  to them:

  - Milestone for release 1.0.0-alpha (feedback)  
  - Milestone for release 1.0.0-beta (feature freeze)  
  - Milestone for release 1.0.0 (stable, hopefully working)  

* The goal of this exercise is to explore established open-source development
  tools and methodologies, and to get familiar with good practices for long-term
  project sustainability.

  You are encouraged to apply a critical view of the strengths and challenges
  during project development, and to adjust conventions and practices to better
  facilitate newcomer onboarding and contributor retention.

* Press any key to start.
