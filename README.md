KobraPy - Programming Exercise
==============================

KobraPy is a programming exercise inspired by the classic 1980s snake game.

Implemented in Python, it provides a minimal yet functional codebase designed
for progressive extension by learners. KobraPy was originally conceived as an
instructional resource to introduce undergraduate computer science students to
open-source development practices and project management methodologies. Beyond
this initial purpose, the project can also serve as a complementary resource
within formal training programs or as a framework for independent study.

KobraPy is free software and may be redistributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public License version 3 or any later version.

The exercise involves:

a) Fixing known issues listed in the repository. b) Enhancing the game by adding
new and engaging features.
